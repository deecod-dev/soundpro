# Volume Manager Chrome Extension

## Overview

**Volume Manager** is a Chrome extension that allows users to control the audio volume of individual tabs. Whether you're listening to music, watching videos, or participating in a webinar, this extension gives you the ability to fine-tune the sound levels across different tabs without affecting the system's master volume.

## Features

- **Tab-Specific Volume Control**: Adjust the volume for each tab independently.
- **Persistent Volume Levels**: The extension remembers volume settings for each tab, even after the browser is closed and reopened.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays the current volume percentage for quick reference.
- **Simple and Intuitive UI**: Easy-to-use popup interface for adjusting volumes and muting tabs.
- **Compatibility with All Sites**: Works on youtube very well, regardless of whether they contain audio or video elements, working on more features currently.

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/volume-manager.git
